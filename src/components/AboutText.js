                            <p className="big-p">I moved to Nashville in 2015 to pursue a career in live sound, and after achieving all of my  goals to that end, it became clear to me that the life of constant touring, gigs, and 24/7  commitment required of you as a sound person was not the life for me. I decided that a  career change was in order, and web development seemed to check every box that I was  looking for in a job. I also realized that my experience in problem solving and the people  skills that I acquired from my live sound experience would translate very well to the world  of web development. Iâ€™m currently enrolled at Nashville Software School and am eager to  begin my journey as a full-stack developer!
